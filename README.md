### Credit Card Data - Data Manipulation

Once upon a time, I had a challenge to develop that was my first project in Data Science. The issue was related to credit, more precisely, to a study of the credit card limit.

So here the ideia is to discuss the data manipulation. I simulated here an example of dataset with some features as name Client, Date Purchases, Numbers of Installments, Value of the Purchases (R$): [Access the dataset here!](https://github.com/mfigueiro/Credit-Card-Data/blob/master/Dados.csv)

The biggest challenge that I had here was to create the variable with the total value of the purchases by each month, where I should take into consideration the numbers of installments. In the time, I had created an algorithm in R with a lot of for loops and nevertheless the running time was long.

Now I present here two possible solutions to mitigate this time of execution using more appropriate functions in Python ([Access code in Python here!](https://github.com/mfigueiro/Credit-Card-Data/blob/master/TemplatePython.ipynb)) and in R ([Access code in R here!](https://github.com/mfigueiro/Credit-Card-Data/blob/master/Rtemplate.R)).

I really would to thanks the data scientist Teo Calvo for the code template in Python and the statistician Iann√≠ Muliterno for the suggesting of the function to create the variable "Mes_Explode" in R. 

Any additional sugestion, please, let me know!!!
